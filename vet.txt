Good Morning Dr. Kross,

I wanted to follow up on Louie's appointment from a few weeks ago. I mentioned there might've been paperwork missing for him but after talking to my girlfriend who had him for some time while I was away it seems that everything was in the folder. So he has taken some medications for worms and Giardia, and now he’s currently taking the Tylan Powder medication you recommended. At first he seemed as if he was doing better. He was having larger, more solid stools. As time passed and as of right now, he is once again having loose stools with steaks of blood during but mostly after. He goes several times when outside (3-4) with the last being the worst of them all. I mentioned his stools fluctuate with time, getting better and then worse so it’s hard to tell if the medication had any effect initially or if that was part of his natural up and downs. Poor Louie has plenty of energy, is eating and drinking but I know it must be uncomfortable for him since he wakes up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom on some nights. I usually take him out ~10PM before he goes to bed. He has not switched foods because I wanted to try one thing at a time to pinpoint the issue. He currently eats this https://frommfamily.com/products/dog/gold/dry/#puppy-gold and you mentioned switching him to an adult formula and to try to stay away from chicken so I will be switching to new food. I wanted to update you on his status and maybe see where we could go from here. Have a great day!
